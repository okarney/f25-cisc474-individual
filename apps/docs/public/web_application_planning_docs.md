**Unique submission feature:** In the context of a music course, for some submissions, the user will be shown a music staff. 
They will need to correctly place the notes on the staff with correct rhythm, pitch and other notational elements. Other assignments
could include a prompt like "Write X measures of music using at least X whole notes and X quarter notes."
